                During undergrad, we used to joke that Fater always followed me wherever I went (or I always followed him). We met in Calvary Arrows as students in JSS1. Though we went to different universities in Nigeria initially, God brought us together again when we both received scholarships to study in the same university and program in Russia.

                    There, we became classmates and roommates throughout our undergraduate years. Over time, we moved from being strangers to friends‚Äîand now, brothers. I met Fxentso for the first time at a Students for Christ (SFC) Winter Camp some years ago in Russia. I remember the excitement of meeting someone from my part of Nigeria - it felt like a rare treasure.

                    We've seen a lot. From naive days in secondary school, through culture shock and cold winters in a new country, we've grown, learned, and adapted together. I still faintly remember a dream I had over eight years ago about your wedding. I shared it with you back then, not knowing what or when it meant. But seeing it come to pass today fills me with joy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You have found a good thing‚Äîand more than that, you've found God's favour. I rejoice with you for this answered prayer. May your marriage reflect His heart, full of grace, selflessness, purpose, joy, peace, and light.

                I don't know if you've ever come across this quote or meme before: "That one person that comes into your life in the most random way but has now become the most important part of it." Yes, that person for me is Fxentso ‚Äî or "Fx," as I like to call herüòä.

                    I met Fx in Russia, the winter of 2018, with absolutely no prior knowledge of her. We were in the same school and lived in the same hostel for our Russian language preparatory course. Less frequent chats became more frequent ones. A few minutes of phone calls turned into hours of chitchats, laughter, banter, deep and spiritual conversations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She became my safe space, my confidant ‚Äî and I, hers. You know one thing I love about Fx? She always says she's proud of me. Oh, how those words melt my heart every time! When I finally found out that she was taken (Brother Fater pulled a fast one on me ‚Äî but I forgive him), I was overjoyed, elated, ecstatic‚Ä¶ pleasantly surprised and delightedüòÅ.

                    I am very confident that this is a kingdom marriage ‚Äî not just because two Christians are getting married, but also because this union is by divine will and will fulfill divine mandate.
